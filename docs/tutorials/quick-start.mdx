## Introduction

Welcome to the Redux Quick Start tutorial! This tutorial will introduce you to Redux, so that you can begin using it as quickly as possible. By the time you finish, you should be able to start building your own Redux applications using the tools and patterns you've learned here.

### How to Use This Tutorial

This page will focus on showing you _how_ to use Redux the right way, and explain just enough of the concepts so that you can understand how to build Redux apps correctly.

We've tried to keep these explanations beginner-friendly, but we do need to make some assumptions about what you know already:

:::important Prerequisites

- Familiarity with [HTML & CSS](https://internetingishard.com/).
- Familiarity with ES6 syntax and features
- Knowledge of React terminology: JSX, State, Function Components, Props, Lifecycle, and Hooks
- Knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript and making AJAX calls

:::

If you're not already comfortable with those topics, we encourage you to take some time to become comfortable with them first, and then come back to learn about Redux. We'll be here when you're ready!

You should make sure that you have the Redux DevTools extension installed in your browser:

- [Redux DevTools Extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
- [Redux DevTools Extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/)

If you'd like to know more details about specific concepts, we'll have links to other parts of the documentation that will tell you more about how Redux works and the patterns you use with Redux:
