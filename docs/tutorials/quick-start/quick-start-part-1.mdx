# Quick Start, Part 1: Redux Concepts and Structure

:::tip What You'll Learn

- What Redux is and why you might want to use it
- Key Redux terms and concepts
- The structure of a typical React + Redux app

:::

## Introduction

Welcome to the Redux Quick Start tutorial! This tutorial will introduce you to Redux, so that you can begin using it as quickly as possible. By the time you finish, you should be able to start building your own Redux applications using the tools and patterns you've learned here.

In Part 1 of this tutorial, we'll cover the key concepts and terms you need to know to use Redux, and we'll examine a typical React + Redux app to see how the pieces fit together.

In [Part 2](./quick-start-part-2.md), we'll use that knowledge to build a small blogging app with some real-world features.

### How to Read This Tutorial

This page will focus on showing you _how_ to use Redux the right way, and explain just enough of the concepts so that you can understand how to build Redux apps correctly.

We've tried to keep these explanations beginner-friendly, but we do need to make some assumptions about what you know already:

:::important Prerequisites

- Familiarity with [HTML & CSS](https://internetingishard.com/).
- Familiarity with ES6 syntax and features
- Knowledge of React terminology: JSX, State, Function Components, Props, Lifecycle, and Hooks
- Knowledge of asynchronous JavaScript and making AJAX calls

:::

If you're not already comfortable with those topics, we encourage you to take some time to become comfortable with them first, and then come back to learn about Redux. We'll be here when you're ready!

You should make sure that you have the Redux DevTools extension installed in your browser:

- [Redux DevTools Extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)
- [Redux DevTools Extension for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reduxdevtools/)

If you'd like to know more details about specific concepts, we'll have links to other parts of the documentation that will tell you more about how Redux works and the patterns you use with Redux:

## What is Redux?

It helps to understand what this "Redux" thing is in the first place. What does it do? What problems does it help me solve? Why would I want to use it?

**Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions".** It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

### Why Should I Use Redux?

Redux helps you manage "global" state - state that is needed across many parts of your application.

The patterns and tools provided by Redux make it easier to understand when, where, why, and how the state in your application is being updated, and how your application logic will behave when those changes occur. Redux guides you towards writing code that is predictable and testable, which helps give you confidence that your application will work as expected.

### When Should I Use Redux?

Redux helps you deal with shared state management, but like any tool, it has tradeoffs. There's more concepts to learn, and more code to write. It also adds some indirection to your code, and asks you to follow certain restrictions. It's a trade-off between short term and long term productivity.

Redux is more useful when:

- You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
- The app state is updated frequently over time
- The logic to update that state may be complex
- The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people

Not all apps need Redux. Take some time to think about the kind of app you're building, and decide what tools would be best to help solve the problems you're working on.

### Redux Libraries and Tools

Redux is a small standalone JS library. However, it is commonly used with several other packages:

#### React-Redux

Redux can integrate with any UI framework, and is most frequently used with React. [**React-Redux**](https://react-redux.js.org/) is our official package that lets your React components interact with a Redux store by reading pieces of state and dispatching actions to update the store.

#### Redux Toolkit

[**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) is our recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

#### Redux DevTools Extension

The [**Redux DevTools Extension**](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) shows a history of the changes to the state in your Redux store over time. This allows you to debug your applications effectively, including using powerful techniques like "time-travel debugging".

## Redux Terms and Concepts

Before we dive into some actual code, let's talk about some of the terms and concepts you'll need to know to use Redux.

### Understanding State Management

Let's start by looking at a React counter component:

```js
function Counter() {
  // State: a counter value
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0)

  // Action: code that causes an update to the state when something happens
  const increment = () => {
    setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1)
  }

  // View: the UI definition
  return (
    <div>
      Value: {counter} <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

It is a self-contained app with the following parts:

- The **state**, the source of truth that drives our app;
- The **view**, a declarative description of the UI based on the current state
- The **actions**, the events that occur in the app based on user input, and trigger updates in the state

This is a small example of **"one-way data flow"**:

- State describes the condition of the app at a specific point in time
- The UI is rendered based on that state
- When something happens (such as a user clicking a button), the state is updated based on what occurred
- The UI re-renders based on the new state

![One-way data flow](/img/tutorials/one-way-data-flow.png)

However, the simplicity can break down when we have **multiple components that need to share and use the same state**, especially if those components are located in different parts of the application. Sometimes this can be solved by ["lifting state up"](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html) to parent components, but that doesn't always help.

So why don't we extract the shared state out of the components, and manage it in a global singleton? With this, our component tree becomes a big "view", and any component can access the state or trigger actions, no matter where they are in the tree!

By defining and separating the concepts involved in state management and enforcing rules that maintain independence between views and states, we give our code more structure and maintainability.

This is the basic idea behind Redux: a single centralized place to contain the global state in your application, and specific patterns to follow when updating that state to make the code predictable.

### Terminology

There's some important Redux terms that you'll need to be familiar with before we continue:

#### Actions

An **action** is a plain JavaScript object that has a `type` field. **You can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application**.

The `type` field should be a string that gives this action a descriptive name, like `"todos/todoAdded"`. We usually write that type string like `"domain/eventName"`, where the first part is the feature or category that this action belongs to, and the second part is the specific thing that happened.

An action object can have other fields with additional information about what happened. By convention, we put that information in a field called `payload`.

A typical action object might look like this:

```js
const addTodoAction = {
  type: 'todos/todoAdded',
  payload: 'Buy milk'
}
```

#### Action Creators

An **action creator** is a function that creates and returns an action object. We typically use these so we don't have to write the action object by hand every time:

```js
const addTodo = text => {
  return {
    type: 'todos/todoAdded',
    payload: 'Buy milk'
  }
}
```

#### Reducers

A **reducer** is a function that receives the current `state` and an `action` object, decides how to update the state if necessary, and returns the new state.

Reducers must _always_ follow some specific rules:

- They should only calculate the new state value based on the `state` and `action` arguments
- They are not allowed to modify the existing `state`. Instead, they must make _immutable updates_, by copying the existing `state` and making changes to the copied values.
- They must not do any asynchronous logic or other "side effects"

We'll talk more about the rules of reducers later, including why they're important and how to follow them correctly.

```js
const initialState = { value: 0 }

function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  // Check to see if the reducer cares about this action
  if (action.type === 'counter/increment') {
    // If so, make a copy of `state`
    return {
      ...state,
      // and update the copy with the new value
      value: state.value + 1
    }
  }
  // otherwise return the existing state unchanged
  return state
}
```

#### Store

The current Redux application state lives in an object called the **store** .

The store is created by passing in a reducer, and has a method called `getState` that returns the current state value:

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterReducer })

console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 0}
```

#### Dispatch

The Redux store has a method called `dispatch`. The only way to update the state is to call `store.dispatch()` and pass in an action object. The store will run its reducer function and save the new state value inside, and we can call `getState()` to retrieve the updated value:

```js
store.dispatch({ type: 'counter/increment' })

console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 1}
```

**You can think of dispatching actions as "triggering an event"** in the application. Something happened, and we want the store to know about it. Reducers act like event listeners, and when they hear an action they are interested in, they update the state in response.

We typically call action creators to dispatch the right action:

```js
const increment = () => {
  return {
    type: 'counter/increment'
  }
}

store.dispatch(increment())

console.log(store.getState())
// {value: 2}
```

#### Selectors

**Selectors** are functions that know how to extract specific pieces of information from a store state value. As an application grows bigger, this can help avoid repeating logic as different parts of the app need to read the same data:

```js
const selectCounterValue = state => state.value

const currentValue = selectCounterValue(store.getState())
console.log(currentValue)
// 2
```

## Examining a React and Redux App

Now that you know the pieces that make up a Redux app, let's look at a real working example to see how these pieces fit together.

### The Counter Example App

The sample project we'll look at is a small counter application that lets us add or subtract from a number as we click buttons. It may not be very exciting, but it shows all the important pieces of a React+Redux application in action.

The project has been created using [the official Redux template for Create-React-App](https://github.com/reduxjs/cra-template-redux). Out of the box, it has already been configured with a standard Redux application structure, using [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org) to create the Redux store and logic, and [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org) to connect together the Redux store and the React components.

Here's the live version of the project. You can play around with it by clicking the buttons in the app preview on the right, and browse through the source files on the left.

<iframe

If you'd like to try create this project on your own computer, you can [start a new Create-React-App project](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started#selecting-a-template) using our Redux template:

```
npx create-react-app redux-quickstart-example --template redux
```

#### Using the Counter App

The counter app has already been set up to let us watch what happens inside as we use it.

Try right-clicking inside the app preview in your browser, and choose "Inspect" from the menu to open up your browser's DevTools. Then, choose the "Redux" tab in the DevTools, and click the "State" button in the upper-right toolbar. You should see something that looks like this:

![Redux DevTools: initial app state](/img/tutorials/quickstart-devtools-initial.png)

On the right, we can see that our Redux store is starting off with an app state value that looks like this:

```js
{
  counter: {
    value: 0
  }
}
```

The DevTools will show us how the store state changes as we use the app.

Let's play with the app first to see what it does. Click the "+" button in the app, then look at the "Diff" tab in the Redux DevTools:

![Redux DevTools: first dispatched action](/img/tutorials/quickstart-devtools-first-action.png)

We can see two important things here:

- When we clicked the "+" button, an action with a type of `"counter/increment"` was dispatched to the store
- When that action was dispatched, the `state.counter.value` field changed from `0` to `1`

Now try these steps:

- Click the "+" button again. The displayed value should now be 2.
- Click the "-" button once. The displayed value should now be 1.
- Click the "Add Amount" button. The displayed value should now be 3.
- Change the number "2" in the textbox to a "3"
- Click the "Add Async" button. You should see a progress bar fill the button, and after a couple seconds, the displayed value should change to 6.

Go back to the Redux DevTools. You should see a total of five actions dispatched, one for each time we clicked a button . Now select the last `"counter/increment"` entry from the list on the left, and click the "Action" tab on the right side:

![Redux DevTools: done clicking buttons](/img/tutorials/quickstart-devtools-done-clicking.png)

We can see that this action object looked like this:

```js
{
  type: 'counter/incrementByAmount',
  payload: 3
}
```

And if you click the "Diff" tab, you can see that the `state.counter.value` field changed from a `3` to a `6`.

The ability to see what is happening inside of our app and how our state is changing over time is very powerful!

### Creating the Redux Store

Now that you know what the app does, let's look at how it works.

Here are the key files that make up this application:

- `/src`
  - `index.js`: the starting point for the app
  - `App.js`: the top-level React component
  - `/app`
    - `store.js`: creates the Redux store instance
  - `/features`
    - `/counter`
      - `Counter.js`: a React component that shows the UI for the counter feature
      - `counterSlice.js`: the Redux logic for the counter feature

Let's start by looking at how the Redux store is created.

Open up `app/store.js`, which should look like this:

**TODO filename title here**

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import counterReducer from '../features/counter/counterSlice'

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
})
```

The Redux store is created using the `configureStore` function from Redux Toolkit. `configureStore` requires that we pass in a `reducer` argument.

Our application might be made up of many different features, and each of those features might have its own reducer function. When we call `configureStore`, we can pass in all of the different reducers in an object. The key names in the object will define the keys in our final state value.

We have a file named `features/counter/counterSlice.js` that exports a reducer function for the counter logic. We can import that `counterReducer` function here, and include it when we create the store.

When we pass in an object like `{counter: counterReducer}`, that says that we want to have a `state.counter` section of our Redux state object, and that we want the `counterReducer` function to be in charge of deciding if and how to update the `state.counter` section whenever an action is dispatched.

#### Redux Slices

**A "slice" is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your app**, typically defined together in a single file. The name comes from splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple "slices" of state.

For example, in a blogging app, our store setup might look like:

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import usersReducer from '../features/users/usersSlice'
import postsReducer from '../features/posts/postsSlice'
import commentsReducer from '../features/comments/commentsSlice'

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    users: usersReducer,
    posts: postsReducer,
    comments: commentsReducer
  }
})
```

In that example, `state.users`, `state.posts`, and `state.comments` are each a separate "slice" of the Redux state. Since `usersReducer` is responsible for updating the `state.users` slice, we refer to it as a "slice reducer" function.

<DetailedExplanation title="Detailed Explanation: Reducers and State Structure">

A Redux store needs to have a single "root reducer" function passed in when it's created. So if we have many different slice reducer functions, how do we get a single root reducer instead, and how does this define the contents of the Redux store state?

If we tried calling all of the slice reducers by hand, it might look like this:

```js
function rootReducer(state = {}, action) {
  return {
    users: usersReducer(state.users, action),
    posts: postsReducer(state.posts, action),
    comments: commentsReducer(state.comments, action)
  }
}
```

That calls each slice reducer individually, passes in the specific slice of the Redux state, and includes the return value in the final new Redux state object.

Redux has a function called [`combineReducers`](../../api/combineReducers.md) that does this for us automatically. It accepts an object full of slice reducers as its argument, and returns a function that calls each slice reducer whenever an action is dispatched. The result from each slice reducer are all combined together into a single object as the final result. We can do the same thing as the previous example using `combineReducers`:

```js
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  users: usersReducer,
  posts: postsReducer,
  comments: commentsReducer
})
```

When we pass an object of slice reducers to `configureStore`, it passes those to `combineReducers` for us to generate the root reducer.

As we saw earlier, you can also pass a reducer function directly as the `reducer` argument:

```js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer
})
```

</DetailedExplanation>

### The Counter Slice

Since we know that the `counterReducer` function is coming from `feature/counter/counterSlice.js`, let's see what's in that file:

**TODO file name here**

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: {
    value: 0
  },
  reducers: {
    increment: state => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: state => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    }
  }
})

export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

// The function below is called a thunk and allows us to perform async logic. It
// can be dispatched like a regular action: `dispatch(incrementAsync(10))`. This
// will call the thunk with the `dispatch` function as the first argument. Async
// code can then be executed and other actions can be dispatched
export const incrementAsync = amount => dispatch => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    dispatch(incrementByAmount(amount))
  }, 1000)
}

// The function below is called a selector and allows us to select a value from
// the state. Selectors can also be defined inline where they're used instead of
// in the slice file. For example: `useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)`
export const selectCount = state => state.counter.value

export default counterSlice.reducer
```

Let's break this down piece by piece.
